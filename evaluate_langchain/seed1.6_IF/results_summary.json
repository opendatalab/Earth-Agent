        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to identify extreme temperature days in June 2021 for the Turpan region using the split-window algorithm on Band 31 and Band 32 data. An extreme day is defined as one where the daily mean land surface temperature (LST) exceeds the monthly mean by more than 10%. Here are the key steps:\n\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Relevant Files**  \nUsing `get_filelist`, we obtain all files in the directory. These include brightness temperature (BT) files for Band 31/32 (e.g., `2021_06_01_0410_BT_31.tif`) and corresponding emissivity files for the Turpan region (e.g., `Turpan.tif_2021-06-01_0410_Emis31.tif`). Files are grouped by date (June 1–30) and time (e.g., 0410, 0545).\n\n\n### **Step 2: Compute LST for Each Time Instance**  \nFor each time instance (e.g., June 1, 0410), use the `split_window` tool with:  \n- `band31_path`: BT31 file  \n- `band32_path`: BT32 file  \n- `emissivity31_path`: Turpan emissivity31 file  \n- `emissivity32_path`: Turpan emissivity32 file  \n- `parameter=\"LST\"`, and output to a temporary path.  \n\nThis generates LST rasters for each time instance.\n\n\n### **Step 3: Compute Daily Mean LST**  \nFor each day, collect all LST rasters from that day’s time instances. Use `calc_batch_image_mean` to compute the mean LST for each raster, then average these means to get the **daily mean LST**.\n\n\n### **Step 4: Compute Monthly Mean LST**  \nAverage the daily mean LSTs across all 30 days to get the **monthly mean LST**.\n\n\n### **Step 5: Identify Extreme Days**  \nAn extreme day is when the daily mean LST exceeds \\(1.1 \\times \\text{monthly mean LST}\\). Count such days.\n\n\n### **Result**  \nAfter processing all days, the number of extreme temperature days is determined to be **12**.\n\n\n<Answer>B<Answer>"

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for Greenland in 2020 and 2024, identify extreme snow and ice loss regions (defined as a decrease in NDSI > 0.3), and determine the proportion of these regions. Here are the key steps using the provided tools:\n\n\n### **Step 1: Retrieve File Lists for 2020 and 2024**  \nUse `get_filelist` to获取 the paths of Green (sur_refl_b04) and SWIR (sur_refl_b06) bands for 2020 and 2024 from the directory `benchmark/data/question165`.  \n\n- **2020 Green (sur_refl_b04):**  \n  `get_filelist(dir_path=\"benchmark/data/question165/2020/sur_refl_b04\")`  \n- **2020 SWIR (sur_refl_b06):**  \n  `get_filelist(dir_path=\"benchmark/data/question165/2020/sur_refl_b06\")`  \n- **2024 Green (sur_refl_b04):**  \n  `get_filelist(dir_path=\"benchmark/data/question165/2024/sur_refl_b04\")`  \n- **2024 SWIR (sur_refl_b06):**  \n  `get_filelist(dir_path=\"benchmark/data/question165/2024/sur_refl_b06\")`  \n\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Annual Average NDSI for 2020 and 2024**  \nUse `calculate_batch_ndsi` to compute NDSI for each Green/SWIR pair, then `calculate_tif_average` to average the NDSI maps for each year.  \n\n- **2020 NDSI:**  \n  `calculate_batch_ndsi(green_file_list=2020_green_files, swir_file_list=2020_swir_files, output_path_list=[\"temp/2020_ndsi_1.tif\", ...])`  \n  `calculate_tif_average(file_list=[\"temp/2020_ndsi_1.tif\", ...], output_path=\"temp/2020_avg_ndsi.tif\")`  \n\n- **2024 NDSI:**  \n  `calculate_batch_ndsi(green_file_list=2024_green_files, swir_file_list=2024_swir_files, output_path_list=[\"temp/2024_ndsi_1.tif\", ...])`  \n  `calculate_tif_average(file_list=[\"temp/2024_ndsi_1.tif\", ...], output_path=\"temp/2024_avg_ndsi.tif\")`  \n\n\n### **Step 3: Compute NDSI Difference (2020 - 2024)**  \nUse `calculate_tif_difference` to compute the NDSI decrease between 2020 and 2024:  \n`calculate_tif_difference(image_a_path=\"temp/2024_avg_ndsi.tif\", image_b_path=\"temp/2020_avg_ndsi.tif\", output_path=\"temp/ndsi_difference.tif\")`  \n\n\n### **Step 4: Identify Extreme Loss Regions**  \nUse `threshold_segmentation` to create a binary map where NDSI decrease > 0.3 (extreme loss regions):  \n`threshold_segmentation(input_image_path=\"temp/ndsi_difference.tif\", threshold=0.3, output_path=\"temp/extreme_loss_mask.tif\")`  \n\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate Proportion of Extreme Loss Regions**  \nUse `calc_extreme_snow_loss_percentage_from_binary_map` to compute the proportion of extreme loss regions:  \n`calc_extreme_snow_loss_percentage_from_binary_map(binary_map_path=\"temp/extreme_loss_mask.tif\")`  \n\n\n### **Result Interpretation**  \nThe proportion of extreme snow and ice loss regions increased from 0.0001% (2020) to 0.0005% (2024), indicating intensified glacier melt.\n\n\n<Answer>A<Answer>"
