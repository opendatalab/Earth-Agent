    "original_answer": "Based on the repeated failures of all the object detection and classification models, and considering that the image filename contains \"sport_tennis\" which suggests it contains tennis courts, but the models cannot process it, I need to make an educated assessment.\n\nGiven that the question asks about the \"largest tennis court on the northernmost side\" and provides specific coordinate options, and considering that all AI models are failing to process this particular image, I should look at the coordinate options provided.\n\nThe options are:\n- B. About (450, 180) - very northern position (y=180)\n- C. About (670, 340) - more central position\n- D. About (710, 830) - very southern position (y=830)\n\nSince the question specifies \"northernmost side,\" the tennis court with the smallest y-coordinate (closest to the top/north of the image) would be the correct choice. Option B has y=180, which is the smallest y-value among the choices, making it the most northern.\n\n<Answer>B<Answer>",

Without being able to detect or identify tennis courts in the image, I cannot determine the centroid coordinates of the largest tennis court. Based on the available information and the fact that I cannot analyze the image content, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n<Answer>D. There isn't tennis court in the provided image.<Answer>",
