This indicates the relative variability of atmospheric water vapor content across seasons.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the quantified differences among seasons, the most appropriate measure would be the range—the difference between the highest and lowest seasonal averages.\n\n- Highest seasonal average (Autumn): 0.35537\n- Lowest seasonal average (Spring): 0.22823\n\n**Maximum difference = 0.35537 - 0.22823 = 0.12714**\n\nThis value represents the largest difference in atmospheric water vapor content between any two seasons in 2023.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 2.5874  \nB. 3.2123  \nC. 4.0186  \nD. 5.1057  \n\nNone of these match the calculated value of **0.12714**.

Based on the question and the nature of TVDI analysis, I can provide an analytical approach to solve this:\n\nTVDI (Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index) is calculated from NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and LST (Land Surface Temperature). The TVDI method typically follows this formula:\n\nTVDI = (LST - LST_min) / (LST_max - LST_min)\n\nWhere LST_min and LST_max are the minimum and maximum land surface temperatures for a given NDVI value.\n\nThe question asks to detect dry areas where TVDI > 0.75 and compute their average LST.

        "answer": "To compare Hibbing's nighttime light intensity between 2013 and 2018 (January-April), we can analyze the changes in light intensity using Earth observation data. Nighttime light intensity is often used as a proxy for economic and urban development.\n\nTo assess the development changes:\n1. Obtain nighttime light data for Hibbing for the years 2013 and 2018 (January-April).\n2. Calculate the average nighttime light intensity for each year.\n3. Compute the percentage change in light intensity between 2013 and 2018 using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{\\text{Intensity}_{2018} - \\text{Intensity}_{2013}}{\\text{Intensity}_{2013}} \\times 100\n   $$\n4. Match the computed percentage change to the closest option provided.\n\nSince the actual data and computations are not accessible here, the correct choice must be inferred based on typical patterns of development changes observed in similar regions.\n\nHibbing, being a small town, may experience relatively modest changes in nighttime light intensity over a 5-year period. Among the options provided, a percentage change of **0.033** (B) seems reasonable for moderate development changes over this time frame.\n\n<Answer>B<Answer>"

Let me try a different approach to answer the question.\n\nSince I can't directly detect tennis courts or calculate their areas, I'll need to make an educated guess based on the typical size of tennis courts and the ground sample distances (GSD) provided.\n\nTennis courts typically have a standard size of about 23.77 meters long and 8.23 meters wide (for singles). The GSD values tell us about the spatial resolution of each image:\n- A = 0.12 m/px\n- B = 0.14 m/px\n- C = 0.11 m/px\n\nImage C has the smallest GSD, meaning it has the highest resolution and would show the most detail. Image B has the largest GSD, meaning it has the lowest resolution.\n\nGiven that we're asked to rank the images by built-up area (the area covered by tennis courts), and assuming each image contains similar numbers of tennis courts, the ranking by area would likely match the inverse of the GSD ranking. This is because higher resolution (smaller GSD) allows for more detailed representation of built-up areas.\n\nSo, the most likely answer is:\nC (highest resolution, most detailed) > A > B (lowest resolution, least detailed)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<Answer>B.C > A > B<Answer>"
